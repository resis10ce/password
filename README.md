# password
finds your password if it is based in your name


---------------How I got This idea----------------
I got this idea. when i started learn bug hunting. one day , i found glitch in my collge site.
I thought to bruteforce it with my regular password file :) basically.. passwords from  haddix sir repositary #seclist.
some where in my mind .. 
I Was knowing that i will not get the match..
I thought since domain is regestred with the vc's name . It might me with his name..

Eg: Gumla
    gum7@
    guml4
    gumla@123 etc
    
   This way i  started to build up this script..
